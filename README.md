# Skills Ladder Data Analysis 

[Skills Ladder](http://skillsladder.co.uk/) is an IT training company based in Gloucestershire, the United Kingdom. This notebook uncovers demographic inisghts about the company's trainees. It shows that the company's younger trainees are more likely to work part-time, have higher qualifications, be from diverse backgrounds, and be more open (based on the fact that a greater number of people in their 40s + opted for 'prefer not to say' when it came to the single parent hoursehold question).
